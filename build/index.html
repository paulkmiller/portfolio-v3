    <p>I&#39;m a seasoned Front End Developer who loves bringing designs to 
      life through code. There&#39;s nothing quite like the thrill of 
      transforming a static mockup into an interactive, engaging 
      experience that users can enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>Over the years, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to work with a wide range 
      of technologies, from JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue to 
      backend systems like Ruby on Rails and PHP. More recently, I&#39;ve 
      been diving into SvelteKit and Go, along with headless CMS solutions 
      like Strapi and Contentful.
    </p>
    <p>If you&#39;re looking for a Front End Developer who&#39;s equal parts creative 
      and technical, I&#39;d love to chat. Feel free to check out my blog to see 
      what I&#39;m up to! And if you have a design that you&#39;re eager to see 
      brought to life, let&#39;s definitely talk!

For years, I had been colloquially dubbing Virginia, specifically NOVA, “the black hole of the East Coast”. I imagine many of my contemporaries living in expensive areas across the United States have similar names for their current homes as \u003Ca href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/home-prices-soaring-bubble/story?id=110101842\" rel=\"nofollow\">housing prices continue to rise\u003C/a>, year over year, with seemingly no cap in sight and no action from Congress to curtail continued explosive growth in living costs. Full of hope and bravado from cursory glances at Redfin and Apartments.com, I convinced my fiancé, a life-long Coloradoan, to return to her home state so I could escape the muck and insane 90%+ humdity of Virginia and Washington D.C.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Have you ever moved across the country like this?” I recall her asking. She was right to ask, of course, because I had only ever made these sorts of drastic location changes with very little to move. And even then, I’d wager most people would agree that moving a few hours away from home is hardly what qualifies as “drastic”.

A “14er” is a mountain that ascenders to 14,000’ or higher in elevation and let me tell ya— there is no shortage of mountains to choose from in Colorado. One of the most memorable experiences during our time in Denver was conquering my first 14er, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.outdoortrailmaps.com/mount-sherman-14036-ft/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mount Sherman\u003C/a>. The bottom of the trail is home to several abandoned mining stations, all rusted and decayed from decades of disuse, until the easily walkable dirt trails give way to a sea of stacked flat stones that make each step a calculated effort. I had forgotten what it was like to truly push myself to my physical limit since I stopped playing Rugby, but near the summit, my body began to give up as fatigue and colorie deficiency set in. A peanut-butter bar and a gatorade later, I joined Kristen for the last leg of the trek until we had finally made it to the top. As I stood at the summit, gasping for air in the thin mountain atmosphere, I felt a sense of accomplishment unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The view from the top was breathtaking, with endless peaks stretching out before me in every direction. I could feel the sun on my face and the wind in my hair, and for the half-hour we spent resting at the summit, all the challenges of the move seemed a distant afterthought.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"svelte-kkiy50\">\u003Cimg srcset=\"/images/posts/mt-sherman.avif, /images/posts/mt-sherman.webp, /images/posts/mt-sherman.png\" src=\"/images/posts/mt-sherman.webp\" alt=\"A photo of Kristen, her still insanely fit father, and the barely still-alive me atop Mt.

We especially felt bad for our cats, who went from living as indoor/outdoor cats in a part of VA where they had no natural predators and could roam safely outside, with my trust that they’d come home when called, something that I trained them to do over the first 6 months of their lives with us. They were now confined to an apartment, less than 1000 square feet in size, with just me to keep them company as a remote worker. I also began to quickly miss the cultural diversity afforded to us by being so close to Washington D.C. and having immediate access to the truly world-class Metro in the DMV. But it was done and we had sunk too much money to have regrets, so we settled in, and spent 2 wonderful years in Colorado before it was off to the next adventure as Kristen transitioned into being a travelling Nurse. Now we’re in Arizona and soon after, we’ll be in Oregon. Who knows what’s next, but one thing is certain: I’m so glad we moved. If we hadn’t, we’d still likely be stuck in that black hole of a state, and I wouldn’t have conquered my first 14er, or learned how to fall on my ass 23 different ways while learning to ski.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"svelte-kkiy50\">\u003Cimg srcset=\"/images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.avif, /images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.webp, /images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.png\" src=\"/images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.jpeg\" alt=\"Socks and Dobby, aka 'Big Cat' and 'Little Cat' hanging out on the couch\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-kkiy50\" style=\"height: 420px;\">\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"svelte-kkiy50\">Socks and Dobby, aka 'Big Cat' and 'Little Cat' hanging out on the couch\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>Looking back on our decision to move to Denver, I realize now that it was about more than just escaping the b”lack hole of the East Coast”.

The move tested our relationship, our resilience, and our sense of adventure, but in the end, it brought us closer together and taught us valuable lessons about ourselves and each other. To anyone considering a similar life change, I would say this: Don’t let fear hold you back. Embrace the unknown, take risks, and trust in your ability to adapt and grow.

A peanut-butter bar and a gatorade later, I joined Kristen for the last leg of the trek until we had finally made it to the top. As I stood at the summit, gasping for air in the thin mountain atmosphere, I felt a sense of accomplishment unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The view from the top was breathtaking, with endless peaks stretching out before me in every direction. I could feel the sun on my face and the wind in my hair, and for the half-hour we spent resting at the summit, all the challenges of the move seemed a distant afterthought.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"svelte-kkiy50\">\u003Cimg srcset=\"/images/posts/mt-sherman.avif, /images/posts/mt-sherman.webp, /images/posts/mt-sherman.png\" src=\"/images/posts/mt-sherman.webp\" alt=\"A photo of Kristen, her still insanely fit father, and the barely still-alive me atop Mt.

We especially felt bad for our cats, who went from living as indoor/outdoor cats in a part of VA where they had no natural predators and could roam safely outside, with my trust that they’d come home when called, something that I trained them to do over the first 6 months of their lives with us. They were now confined to an apartment, less than 1000 square feet in size, with just me to keep them company as a remote worker. I also began to quickly miss the cultural diversity afforded to us by being so close to Washington D.C. and having immediate access to the truly world-class Metro in the DMV. But it was done and we had sunk too much money to have regrets, so we settled in, and spent 2 wonderful years in Colorado before it was off to the next adventure as Kristen transitioned into being a travelling Nurse. Now we’re in Arizona and soon after, we’ll be in Oregon. Who knows what’s next, but one thing is certain: I’m so glad we moved. If we hadn’t, we’d still likely be stuck in that black hole of a state, and I wouldn’t have conquered my first 14er, or learned how to fall on my ass 23 different ways while learning to ski.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"svelte-kkiy50\">\u003Cimg srcset=\"/images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.avif, /images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.webp, /images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.png\" src=\"/images/posts/bigcat_and_littlecat.jpeg\" alt=\"Socks and Dobby, aka 'Big Cat' and 'Little Cat' hanging out on the couch\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-kkiy50\" style=\"height: 420px;\">\n  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"svelte-kkiy50\">Socks and Dobby, aka 'Big Cat' and 'Little Cat' hanging out on the couch\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>Looking back on our decision to move to Denver, I realize now that it was about more than just escaping the b”lack hole of the East Coast”. It was about pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones, embracing new experiences, and discovering what we were truly capable of. The move tested our relationship, our resilience, and our sense of adventure, but in the end, it brought us closer together and taught us valuable lessons about ourselves and each other. To anyone considering a similar life change, I would say this: Don’t let fear hold you back. Embrace the unknown, take risks, and trust in your ability to adapt and grow. You never know what incredible experiences and opportunities await you on the other side.\u003C/p>",readingTime:"8 min read"}]}]}}(Array(4),Array(5))),"uses":{}}];
